- When the users pick to use the mortgage calculator, they will be prompted to input the principal amount, the interest rate, and the term period in years. Once they input all the required numbers, the Mortage Calculator will output their monthly rate. In our example, for $53000.0 principal at a 7.625% interest rate for 180.0 months, the monthly payment is $495.09.

- When users choose to use the future value calculator, they are prompted to input their deposit amount, their interest rate, and their term period in years. The calculator then outputs the earned interest rate and the total value of their deposit.

- When users choose to use the Present Value of Ordinary Annuity Calculator, they are prompted to input their desired monthly payment, their interest rate, and the duration of the annuity in years. The calculator will then output the needed investment amount.
